// voltdbclient provides a go client for VoltDB.  voltdbclient
// implements the interfaces specified in the database/sql/driver
// package.  The interfaces specified by database/sql/driver are
// typically used to implement a driver to be used by the
// database/sql package.
//
// In this case, though, voltdbclient can also be used as a
// standalone client.  That is, the code in voltdbclient
// can be used both to implement a voltdb driver for database/sql
// and as a standalone VoltDB client.
//
// voltdbclient supports an asynchronous api as well as the
// standard database/sql/driver api.  The asynchronous api is supported
// by the VoltConn and VoltStatement types.

// queries and other statements.  A VoltConn is initially created with a call
// to OpenConn.

//
// The creation of a VoltConn represents the creation of two associated
// goroutines.  One of these is used to listen for responses from the VoltDB
// server.  The other is used to process responses to asynchronous requests.
//
// A VoltConn should not be shared among goroutines; this is true of
// driver.Conn as well.  But a client can create many instances of a VoltConn.
